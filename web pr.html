  Famous poet Rabindranath Tagore portrayed 
  as ‘a teardrop on the cheek of the universe’ and 
  Kipling called it ‘the embodiment 
  of all things pure’. Mughal emperor Shah Jahan famously 
  said – “it made the moon and the sun drop tears on it”. 
  What is it that we are talking about? Of course the one and only 
  Taj Mahal, a monument built out of immense love and memory, 
  a monument that made hundreds of thousands of people bow down 
  to their knees, a monument that made the city of Agra a famous 
  and widely visited tourist spot in India. It is a place where you’ll 
  fall in love with the Mughal Era and pleasure yourself with the 
  architecture and royalty. And have you seen Taj Mahal at night? If 
  not, then let us tell you it is one of the most magnificent sights ever!

People widely consider it as one of the most beautiful buildings in the world. 
Located in the historical city of Agra, the Taj Mahal is called as the ‘symbol of love’. 
A wide range of visitors come around admiring the beauty of the monument and appreciate the architecture. 
Taj Mahal is known as the Crown of Palaces in Persian, giving a breathtaking sight to its aficionados.
Regarded as one of the finest illustrations of Mughal architecture in India, 
Taj Mahal is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 
One of the best parts of visiting the Taj Mahal is to appreciate the elegance of aptness of extents and 
luxuriousness of geometrical prototypes of such gracefully done gardens that enhance the dignity of the Taj Mahal, 
adding glory to the slenderness of this symbol of love, perseverance and beauty.
